# Pseudo_Arithmetic
This program performs arithmetic operations on strings using a simple algorithm. It allows you to input two strings and an operator (+, -, *, /) to perform the operation and obtain the result.

# Getting Started
Clone the repository or download the source code.
Save the pseudo_arithmetic.c file in a directory.
Open your terminal and change the directory to where the c file was saved.
Compile the source code using a C compiler : gcc pseudo_arithmetic.c -o pseudo_arithmetic
Execute the compiled binary : pseudo_arithmetic

# Usage
Once the program is running, you can interact with it through the command-line interface (CLI). Follow the instructions provided by the program to enter the input in the required format.

Welcome to the String Math Program!
Instructions:
Enter input in the format SOS
S represents a string (1-9 lowercase letters)
O represents a mathematical symbol (+ - * /)
To exit the program, enter the keyphrase: exit

input: abc + abc

You can enter two strings (S) and an operator (O) separated by spaces. The program will perform the operation on each corresponding character and display the result:
abc + abc => bdf

You can continue entering new inputs until you enter the keyphrase "exit", which will terminate the program.

# Limitations
The input strings must consist of lowercase letters (a-z).
The input strings can have a maximum length of 9 characters.
The program operates on a character-by-character basis, maintaining the length of the resulting string.
